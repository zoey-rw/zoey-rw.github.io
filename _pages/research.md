## Forecasting the soil microbiome
This project explores how the soil microbiome might change in the future. We use Bayesian predictive models of soil fungal and bacterial abundances, to try to understand the forces shaping soil microbial communities. The first paper on this project has recently been published [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01445-9), with a corresponding BU article [here] (https://phys.org/news/2021-06-scientists-underground-mystery-microbes.html).

I work closely with the [Dietze Ecological Forecasting Lab](http://people.bu.edu/dietze/index.html). My work on microbial forecasting is part of the [Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative (NEFI)](http://people.bu.edu/dietze/index.html#nefi), which aims to build forecasting systems for a variety of ecological domains.

## Microbial networks
Microbes interact closely with their environments and other microbes. This can take the form of fierce competition for nutrients, cooperation to carry out biogeochemical transformations, predation, etc. These interactions can be represented (visually or mathematically) by networks. However, identifying interactions in a complex microbial community is difficult. I develop methods for combining experimental and field data to better understand microbial interactions. This work is in collaboration with the [Segre Lab](https://www.bu.edu/segrelab/). 

## Mass extinction dynamics 
How do current extinctions compare to the mass extinctions throughout the entire history of life? As an undergraduate at Swarthmore College, I addressed this question with Professor Steve Wang in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. We combined fossil data with modern extinction risks to explore how extinctions affect older or newer lineages. We concluded that age selectivity could be used to distinguish mass extinctions from background extinctions, and our current trajectory is within the "mass extinction" category.
