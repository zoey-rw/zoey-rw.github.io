## Forecasting the soil microbiome
How will the soil microbiome change in the future? Will changes in the soil microbiome affect carbon cycling, agricultural productivity, or pathogen transmission?
To answer these questions, I work closely with the [Dietze Ecological Forecasting Lab](http://people.bu.edu/dietze/index.html). My work on microbial forecasting is part of the [Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative (NEFI)](http://people.bu.edu/dietze/index.html#nefi), which aims to build forecasting systems for a variety of ecological domains.

I study the spatial and temporal abundance patterns of soil fungi and bacteria, and I use Bayesian statistical modeling to try to understand the forces shaping soil microbial communities. The first paper on this project has recently been published [here](link).

## Microbial networks
Microbes interact closely with their environments and other microbes. This can take the form of fierce competition for nutrients, cooperation to carry out biogeochemical transformations, predation, etc. Networks can be used to visually or mathematically represent these interactions. However, identifying interactions in a complex microbial community is difficult. I develop methods for combining experimental and field data to better understand microbial interactions.

## Mass extinction dynamics 
How do current extinctions compare to the mass extinctions throughout the entire history of life? As an undergraduate at Swarthmore College, I addressed this question with Professor Steve Wang in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. We combined fossil data with modern extinction risks to explore how extinctions affect older or newer lineages. We concluded that age selectivity could be used to distinguish mass extinctions from background extinctions, and our current trajectory is within the "mass extinction" category.

## Data exploration software
For a variety of projects, I've worked on web applications and software to help visualize and explore datasets. 
* I created a [Shiny app](https://zoeywerbin.shinyapps.io/Boston_trees/) to guide urban reforestation in Boston. Urban forests can help counter the "urban heat island" effect, and reduce the mortality and morbidity of heat waves. Read about this project in [PLoS ONE](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224959).
* I created a [Shiny app](https://zoeywerbin.shinyapps.io/ISCN-explore/) to visualize the International Soil Carbon Network Database.
* I developed an early iteration of the [Airborne Data Visualizer](https://daac.ornl.gov/SERVICES/guides/Airborne_RShiny_App.html), hosted by the NASA-funded Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). As an intern at the ORNL DAAC, I also developed an R package to handle ICARTT files, used in atmospheric chemistry research. This package is no longer maintained.
