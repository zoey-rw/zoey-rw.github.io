Hi, my name is Zoey Werbin. I am a PhD candidate in the Bhatnagar Lab at Boston University. I study the ecology of the soil microbiome, using tools from bioinformatics, Bayesian statistics, and network science.

I am funded by a Graduate Research Fellowship from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), as well as a Microbiome Fellowship from the [Boston University Microbiome Initiative](https://sites.bu.edu/microbiome/).
